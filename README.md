### Maze Shortest Path Finder

This program finds the shortest path in a maze between the entry and exit points, implemented in C. Given a maze map, the program calculates the optimal path from the start to the finish, ensuring the shortest possible route.

### Key Features:
- **Input**: A maze map with defined entry and exit points.
- **Output**: The shortest path from the entry to the exit.
- Implements a search algorithm (e.g., BFS) to efficiently explore all possible routes in the maze.
- Handles obstacles and walls, ensuring valid paths are taken.
- Provides a step-by-step output of the path taken.

### Usage:
This program is ideal for solving maze puzzles or any problem that requires finding the shortest path in a grid-like structure. The efficient pathfinding algorithm ensures quick results even in complex mazes.
